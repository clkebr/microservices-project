***MICROSERVICES-PROJECT***

****Introduction****

Welcome to microservices-project, a comprehensive project that explores various aspects of microservices architecture. This project covers a wide range of topics, including building services, inter-process communication, service discovery, API gateway implementation, security measures, circuit breaker, distributed tracing, event-driven architecture, containerization using Docker, and monitoring microservices.

**Overview**

This project aims to provide a hands-on demonstration of best practices and technologies for developing and deploying microservices-based applications. The following sections briefly describe the key components and concepts covered in this project.

*-Build Services:*

The foundation of this project is the development of microservices. Each microservice is designed to perform a specific business function, ensuring a modular and scalable architecture.

*-Inter Process Communication:*

Microservices need to communicate efficiently with each other. This project explores various techniques for inter-process communication to facilitate seamless interaction between microservices.

*-Service Discovery using Netflix Eureka:*

Service discovery is a critical aspect of microservices architecture. Netflix Eureka is employed to enable dynamic service registration and discovery within the system.

*-Implement API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway:*

API gateways play a crucial role in managing and securing communication between clients and microservices. This project demonstrates the implementation of an API gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway.

*-Secure Microservices using Keycloak:*

Security is a top priority in microservices. Keycloak is integrated to provide authentication and authorization services, ensuring that only authorized users can access the microservices.

*-Implement Circuit Breaker:*

To enhance fault tolerance and prevent cascading failures, a circuit breaker pattern is implemented. This mechanism helps the system gracefully handle failures and recover when issues are resolved.

*-Implement Distributed Tracing:*

Distributed tracing is essential for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based systems. This project utilizes a distributed tracing solution to trace requests as they traverse through various microservices.

*-Implement Event Driven Architecture using Kafka:*
Event-driven architecture is adopted for asynchronous communication between microservices. Apache Kafka is employed as a distributed event streaming platform to facilitate seamless event communication.

*-Dockerized the application:*

Containerization using Docker is demonstrated to encapsulate microservices and their dependencies, providing a consistent and portable environment across different deployment environments.

*-Monitoring Microservices using Prometheus and Grafana:*

Monitoring is crucial for identifying and resolving issues proactively. Prometheus and Grafana are integrated to monitor the performance and health of microservices in real-time.

****Getting Started****

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.

Set up the required dependencies such as Docker, Keycloak, etc.

Build and deploy microservices using provided scripts.

Explore the API gateway, access secured microservices, and observe the event-driven architecture in action.

Monitor microservices using Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.
